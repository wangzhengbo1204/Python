    :version: 0.8.0b2

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug

      Fixed a gotcha where inadvertently calling list() on a
      :class:`.ColumnElement` would go into an endless loop, if
      :meth:`.ColumnOperators.__getitem__` were implemented.
      A new NotImplementedError is emitted via ``__iter__()``.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, extensions, feature

      The :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension now includes the
      example :class:`.MutableDict` class as part of the extension.

    .. change::
        :tags: postgresql, feature
        :tickets: 2606

      :class:`.HSTORE` is now available in the Postgresql dialect.
      Will also use psycopg2's extensions if available.  Courtesy
      Audrius Ka≈æukauskas.

    .. change::
        :tags: sybase, feature
        :tickets: 1753

      Reflection support has been added to the Sybase dialect.
      Big thanks to Ben Trofatter for all the work developing and
      testing this.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine, feature

      The :meth:`.Connection.connect` and :meth:`.Connection.contextual_connect`
      methods now return a "branched" version so that the :meth:`.Connection.close`
      method can be called on the returned connection without affecting the
      original.   Allows symmetry when using :class:`.Engine` and
      :class:`.Connection` objects as context managers::

        with conn.connect() as c: # leaves the Connection open
          c.execute("...")

        with engine.connect() as c:  # closes the Connection
          c.execute("...")

    .. change::
        :tags: engine

      The "reflect=True" argument to :class:`MetaData` is deprecated.
      Please use the :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` method.

    .. change::
        :tags: engine, bug
        :tickets: 2604

      Fixed :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` to correctly use
      the given :class:`.Connection`, if given, without
      opening a second connection from that connection's
      :class:`.Engine`.  Also in 0.7.10.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql, bug
        :tickets: 2607

      Fixed bug whereby using "key" with Column
      in conjunction with "schema" for the owning
      Table would fail to locate result rows due
      to the MSSQL dialect's "schema rendering"
      logic's failure to take .key into account.
      Also in 0.7.10.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug
        :tickets: 2603

        Fixed bug in type_coerce() whereby typing information
        could be lost if the statement were used as a subquery
        inside of another statement, as well as other similar
        situations.  Among other things, would cause
        typing information to be lost when the Oracle/mssql dialects
        would apply limit/offset wrappings.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2602

        Fixed regression where query.update() would produce
        an error if an object matched by the "fetch"
        synchronization strategy wasn't locally present.
        Courtesy Scott Torborg.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug
        :tickets: 2597

        Fixed bug whereby the ".key" of a Column wasn't being
        used when producing a "proxy" of the column against
        a selectable.   This probably didn't occur in 0.7
        since 0.7 doesn't respect the ".key" in a wider
        range of scenarios.

    .. change::
        :tags: mssql, feature
        :tickets: 2600

        Support for reflection of the "name" of primary key
        constraints added, courtesy Dave Moore.

.. changelog::
    :version: 0.8.0b1
    :released: October 30, 2012

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, bug
        :tickets: 2593

        Fixed bug where keyword arguments passed to
        :meth:`.Compiler.process` wouldn't get propagated
        to the column expressions present in the columns
        clause of a SELECT statement.  In particular this would
        come up when used by custom compilation schemes that
        relied upon special flags.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, feature

      Added a new method :meth:`.Engine.execution_options`
      to :class:`.Engine`.  This method works similarly to
      :meth:`.Connection.execution_options` in that it creates
      a copy of the parent object which will refer to the new
      set of options.   The method can be used to build
      sharding schemes where each engine shares the same
      underlying pool of connections.   The method
      has been tested against the horizontal shard
      recipe in the ORM as well.

      .. seealso::

          :meth:`.Engine.execution_options`

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, orm, bug
        :tickets: 2595

      The auto-correlation feature of :func:`.select`, and
      by proxy that of :class:`.orm.Query`, will not
      take effect for a SELECT statement that is being
      rendered directly in the FROM list of the enclosing
      SELECT.  Correlation in SQL only applies to column
      expressions such as those in the WHERE, ORDER BY,
      columns clause.

    .. change::
        :tags: sqlite
        :pullreq: 23
        :changeset: c3addcc9ffad

      Added :class:`.types.NCHAR`, :class:`.types.NVARCHAR`
      to the SQLite dialect's list of recognized type names
      for reflection.   SQLite returns the name given
      to a type as the name returned.

    .. change::
        :tags: examples
        :tickets: 2589

      The Beaker caching example has been converted
      to use `dogpile.cache <http://dogpilecache.readthedocs.org/>`_.
      This is a new caching library written by the same
      creator of Beaker's caching internals, and represents a
      vastly improved, simplified, and modernized system of caching.

    .. change::
        :tags: general
        :tickets:

      SQLAlchemy 0.8 now targets Python 2.5 and
      above.  Python 2.4 is no longer supported.

    .. change::
        :tags: removed, general
        :tickets: 2433

      The "sqlalchemy.exceptions"
      synonym for "sqlalchemy.exc" is removed
      fully.

    .. change::
        :tags: removed, orm
        :tickets: 2442

      The legacy "mutable" system of the
      ORM, including the MutableType class as well
      as the mutable=True flag on PickleType
      and postgresql.ARRAY has been removed.
      In-place mutations are detected by the ORM
      using the sqlalchemy.ext.mutable extension,
      introduced in 0.7.   The removal of MutableType
      and associated constructs removes a great
      deal of complexity from SQLAlchemy's internals.
      The approach performed poorly as it would incur
      a scan of the full contents of the Session
      when in use.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, moved
        :tickets:

      The InstrumentationManager interface
      and the entire related system of alternate
      class implementation is now moved out
      to sqlalchemy.ext.instrumentation.   This is
      a seldom used system that adds significant
      complexity and overhead to the mechanics of
      class instrumentation.  The new architecture
      allows it to remain unused until
      InstrumentationManager is actually imported,
      at which point it is bootstrapped into
      the core.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 1401

      Major rewrite of relationship()
      internals now allow join conditions which
      include columns pointing to themselves
      within composite foreign keys.   A new
      API for very specialized primaryjoin conditions
      is added, allowing conditions based on
      SQL functions, CAST, etc. to be handled
      by placing the annotation functions
      remote() and foreign() inline within the
      expression when necessary.  Previous recipes
      using the semi-private _local_remote_pairs
      approach can be upgraded to this new
      approach.

          :ref:`feature_relationship_08`

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2527

      ORM will perform extra effort to determine
      that an FK dependency between two tables is
      not significant during flush if the tables
      are related via joined inheritance and the FK
      dependency is not part of the inherit_condition,
      saves the user a use_alter directive.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2333

      New standalone function with_polymorphic()
      provides the functionality of query.with_polymorphic()
      in a standalone form.   It can be applied to any
      entity within a query, including as the target
      of a join in place of the "of_type()" modifier.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 1106, 2438

      The of_type() construct on attributes
      now accepts aliased() class constructs as well
      as with_polymorphic constructs, and works with
      query.join(), any(), has(), and also
      eager loaders subqueryload(), joinedload(),
      contains_eager()

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2585

      Improvements to event listening for
      mapped classes allows that unmapped classes
      can be specified for instance- and mapper-events.
      The established events will be automatically
      set up on subclasses of that class when the
      propagate=True flag is passed, and the
      events will be set up for that class itself
      if and when it is ultimately mapped.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2590

      The instrumentation events class_instrument(),
      class_uninstrument(), and attribute_instrument()
      will now fire off only for descendant classes
      of the class assigned to listen().  Previously,
      an event listener would be assigned to listen
      for all classes in all cases regardless of the
      "target" argument passed.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 1900

      with_polymorphic() produces JOINs
      in the correct order and with correct inheriting
      tables in the case of sending multi-level
      subclasses in an arbitrary order or with
      intermediary classes missing.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2485

      The "deferred declarative
      reflection" system has been moved into the
      declarative extension itself, using the
      new DeferredReflection class.  This
      class is now tested with both single
      and joined table inheritance use cases.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2208

      Added new core function "inspect()",
      which serves as a generic gateway to
      introspection into mappers, objects,
      others.   The Mapper and InstanceState
      objects have been enhanced with a public
      API that allows inspection of mapped
      attributes, including filters for column-bound
      or relationship-bound properties, inspection
      of current object state, history of
      attributes, etc.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2452

      Calling rollback() within a
      session.begin_nested() will now only expire
      those objects that had net changes within the
      scope of that transaction, that is objects which
      were dirty or were modified on a flush.  This
      allows the typical use case for begin_nested(),
      that of altering a small subset of objects, to
      leave in place the data from the larger enclosing
      set of objects that weren't modified in
      that sub-transaction.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2372

      Added utility feature
      Session.enable_relationship_loading(),
      supersedes relationship.load_on_pending.
      Both features should be avoided, however.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets:

      Added support for .info dictionary argument to
      column_property(), relationship(), composite().
      All MapperProperty classes have an auto-creating .info
      dict available overall.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2229

      Adding/removing None from a mapped collection
      now generates attribute events.  Previously, a None
      append would be ignored in some cases.  Related
      to.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2229

      The presence of None in a mapped collection
      now raises an error during flush.   Previously,
      None values in collections would be silently ignored.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets:

      The Query.update() method is now
      more lenient as to the table
      being updated.  Plain Table objects are better
      supported now, and additional a joined-inheritance
      subclass may be used with update(); the subclass
      table will be the target of the update,
      and if the parent table is referenced in the
      WHERE clause, the compiler will call upon
      UPDATE..FROM syntax as allowed by the dialect
      to satisfy the WHERE clause.  MySQL's multi-table
      update feature is also supported if columns
      are specified by object in the "values" dicitionary.
      PG's DELETE..USING is also not available
      in Core yet.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets:

      New session events after_transaction_create
      and after_transaction_end
      allows tracking of new SessionTransaction objects.
      If the object is inspected, can be used to determine
      when a session first becomes active and when
      it deactivates.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2592

      The Query can now load entity/scalar-mixed
      "tuple" rows that contain
      types which aren't hashable, by setting the flag
      "hashable=False" on the corresponding TypeEngine object
      in use.  Custom types that return unhashable types
      (typically lists) can set this flag to False.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2481

      Improvements to joined/subquery eager
      loading dealing with chains of subclass entities
      sharing a common base, with no specific "join depth"
      provided.  Will chain out to
      each subclass mapper individually before detecting
      a "cycle", rather than considering the base class
      to be the source of the "cycle".

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2320

      The "passive" flag on Session.is_modified()
      no longer has any effect. is_modified() in
      all cases looks only at local in-memory
      modified flags and will not emit any
      SQL or invoke loader callables/initializers.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2405

      The warning emitted when using
      delete-orphan cascade with one-to-many
      or many-to-many without single-parent=True
      is now an error.  The ORM
      would fail to function subsequent to this
      warning in any case.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2350

      Lazy loads emitted within flush events
      such as before_flush(), before_update(),
      etc. will now function as they would
      within non-event code, regarding consideration
      of the PK/FK values used in the lazy-emitted
      query.   Previously,
      special flags would be established that
      would cause lazy loads to load related items
      based on the "previous" value of the
      parent PK/FK values specifically when called
      upon within a flush; the signal to load
      in this way is now localized to where the
      unit of work actually needs to load that
      way.  Note that the UOW does
      sometimes load these collections before
      the before_update() event is called,
      so the usage of "passive_updates" or not
      can affect whether or not a collection will
      represent the "old" or "new" data, when
      accessed within a flush event, based
      on when the lazy load was emitted.
      The change is backwards incompatible in
      the exceedingly small chance that
      user event code depended on the old
      behavior.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2179

      Query now "auto correlates" by
      default in the same way as select() does.
      Previously, a Query used as a subquery
      in another would require the correlate()
      method be called explicitly in order to
      correlate a table on the inside to the
      outside.  As always, correlate(None)
      disables correlation.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2464

      The after_attach event is now
      emitted after the object is established
      in Session.new or Session.identity_map
      upon Session.add(), Session.merge(),
      etc., so that the object is represented
      in these collections when the event
      is called.  Added before_attach
      event to accommodate use cases that
      need autoflush w pre-attached object.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets:

      The Session will produce warnings
      when unsupported methods are used inside the
      "execute" portion of the flush.   These are
      the familiar methods add(), delete(), etc.
      as well as collection and related-object
      manipulations, as called within mapper-level
      flush events
      like after_insert(), after_update(), etc.
      It's been prominently documented for a long
      time that  SQLAlchemy cannot guarantee
      results when the Session is manipulated within
      the execution of the flush plan,
      however users are still doing it, so now
      there's a warning.   Maybe someday the Session
      will be enhanced to support these operations
      inside of the flush, but for now, results
      can't be guaranteed.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2582, 2566

      Continuing regarding extra
      state post-flush due to event listeners;
      any states that are marked as "dirty" from an
      attribute perspective, usually via column-attribute
      set events within after_insert(), after_update(),
      etc., will get the "history" flag reset
      in all cases, instead of only those instances
      that were part of the flush.  This has the effect
      that this "dirty" state doesn't carry over
      after the flush and won't result in UPDATE
      statements.   A warning is emitted to this
      effect; the set_committed_state()
      method can be used to assign attributes on objects
      without producing history events.

      ORM entities can be passed
      to the core select() construct as well
      as to the select_from(),
      correlate(), and correlate_except()
      methods of select(), where they will be unwrapped
      into selectables.

    .. change::

      Some support for auto-rendering of a
      relationship join condition based on the mapped
      attribute, with usage of core SQL constructs.
      E.g. select([SomeClass]).where(SomeClass.somerelationship)
      would render SELECT from "someclass" and use the
      primaryjoin of "somerelationship" as the WHERE
      clause.   This changes the previous meaning
      of "SomeClass.somerelationship" when used in a
      core SQL context; previously, it would "resolve"
      to the parent selectable, which wasn't generally
      useful.  Also works with query.filter().

      The registry of classes
      in declarative_base() is now a
      WeakValueDictionary.  So subclasses of
      "Base" that are dereferenced will be
      garbage collected, *if they are not
      referred to by any other mappers/superclass
      mappers*. See the next note for this ticket.

      Conflicts between columns on
      single-inheritance declarative subclasses,
      with or without using a mixin, can be resolved
      using a new @declared_attr usage described
      in the documentation.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2472

      declared_attr can now be used
      on non-mixin classes, even though this is generally
      only useful for single-inheritance subclass
      column conflict resolution.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2517

      declared_attr can now be used with
      attributes that are not Column or MapperProperty;
      including any user-defined value as well
      as association proxy objects.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, bug
        :tickets: 2565

      Fixed a disconnect that slowly evolved
      between a @declared_attr Column and a
      directly-defined Column on a mixin. In both
      cases, the Column will be applied to the
      declared class' table, but not to that of a
      joined inheritance subclass.   Previously,
      the directly-defined Column would be placed
      on both the base and the sub table, which isn't
      typically what's desired.

    .. change::
        :tags: orm, feature
        :tickets: 2526

      *Very limited* support for
      inheriting mappers to be GC'ed when the
      class itself is deferenced.  The mapper
      must not have its own table (i.e.
      single table inh only) without polymorphic
      attributes in place.

      Major rework of operator system

      at the type level.  New types can be created
      from existing ones which add or redefine
      operations that are exported out to column
      expressions, in a similar manner to how the
      ORM has allowed comparator_factory.   The new

      to augment bind- and result- behavior at the
      SQL level, as opposed to in the Python level.

      The Core oeprator system now includes
      the `getitem` operator, i.e. the bracket
      operator in Python.  This is used at first
      to provide index and slice behavior to the
      Postgresql ARRAY type, and also provides a hook
      for end-user definition of custom __getitem__
      schemes which can be applied at the type
      level as well as within ORM-level custom
      operator schemes.   `lshift` (<<)
      and `rshift` (>>) are also supported as
      optional operators.

      Note that this change has the effect that
      descriptor-based __getitem__ schemes used by
      the ORM in conjunction with synonym() or other
      "descriptor-wrapped" schemes will need
      to start using a custom comparator in order
      to maintain this behavior.

      The behavior of column targeting

      Applying a column expression to a select
      statement using a label with or without other
      modifying constructs will no longer "target" that
      expression to the underlying Column; this affects
      ORM operations that rely upon Column targeting
      in order to retrieve results.  That is, a query
      like query(User.id, User.id.label('foo')) will now
      track the value of each "User.id" expression separately
      instead of munging them together.  It is not expected
      that any users will be impacted by this; however,
      a usage that uses select() in conjunction with
      query.from_statement() and attempts to load fully
      composed ORM entities may not function as expected
      if the select() named Column objects with arbitrary
      .label() names, as these will no longer target to

      be added into this dictionary, and the PG type
      reflection code should be able to handle simple
      types with variable numbers of arguments.
      The functionality here is "unofficial" for
      three reasons:

      1. this is not an "official" API.  Ideally
         an "official" API would allow custom type-handling
         callables at the dialect or global level
         in a generic way.
      2. This is only implemented for the PG dialect,
         in particular because PG has broad support
         for custom types vs. other database backends.
         A real API would be implemented at the
         default dialect level.
      3. The reflection code here is only tested against
         simple types and probably has issues with more
         compositional types.

      The "startswith()" operator renders
      as "STARTING WITH", "~startswith()" renders
      as "NOT STARTING WITH", using FB's more efficient
      operator.

      CompileError is raised when VARCHAR with
      no length is attempted to be emitted, same
      way as MySQL.

      Firebird now uses strict "ansi bind rules"
      so that bound parameters don't render in the
      columns clause of a statement - they render
      literally instead.

      Support for passing datetime as date when
      using the DateTime type with Firebird; other
      dialects support this.

      An experimental dialect for the fdb
      driver is added, but is untested as I cannot
      get the fdb package to build.

      Dialect no longer emits expensive server
      collations query, as well as server casing,
      on first connect.  These functions are still
      available as semi-private.

      Added TIME type to mysql dialect,
      accepts "fst" argument which is the new
      "fractional seconds" specifier for recent
      MySQL versions.  The datatype will interpret
      a microseconds portion received from the driver,
      however note that at this time most/all MySQL
      DBAPIs do not support returning this value.

      Quoting information is now passed along
      from a Column with quote=True when generating
      a same-named bound parameter to the bindparam()
      object, as is the case in generated INSERT and UPDATE
      statements, so that unknown reserved names can
      be fully supported.

      The types of columns excluded from the
      setinputsizes() set can be customized by sending
      a list of string DBAPI type names to exclude,
      using the exclude_setinputsizes dialect parameter.
      This list was previously fixed.  The list also
      now defaults to STRING, UNICODE, removing
      CLOB, NCLOB from the list.

      The CreateIndex construct in Oracle
      will now schema-qualify the name of the index
      to be that of the parent table.  Previously this
      name was omitted which apparently creates the
      index in the default schema, rather than that
      of the table.

        Added :meth:`.ColumnOperators.notin_`,
        :meth:`.ColumnOperators.notlike`,
        :meth:`.ColumnOperators.notilike` to :class:`.ColumnOperators`.

    .. change::
        :tags: sql, removed

        The long-deprecated and non-functional ``assert_unicode`` flag on
        :func:`.create_engine` as well as :class:`.String` is removed.
