This directory contains informal scripts used to stress test various
library subsections over the years, including testing of memory usage,
function call count, threading behavior.

The scripts here are *not* part of the automated test suite, and instead
were used at the time of development for particular features or
performance enhancements in an ad-hoc fashion.  Ideally 
the various functionality tested within would be brought under the 
umbrella of controlled, automated tests.  Many of the scripts here
are out of date and are possibly covered by formal performance tests
elsewhere.

Current automated stress and performance tests are in test/aaa_profiling/, 
which test either for expected function call count, or flat growth in memory 
usage over time.   These tests are part of the automated test suite
and are maintained for 100% success rate along Python versions from 2.4 through
current 3 versions.
